## Features

- **Heatmap visualization** of GitLab contributions.
- **Supports custom username and GitLab token**.
- **Highly customizable** color options and styles.
- **Easy to integrate** into any React project.

## Installation

To use this package, follow these steps:

### 1. Install the package via NPM

Run the following command in your terminal to install the `gitlab-contribution-graph` package:

```bash
npm install gitlab-contribution-graph

2. Install required dependencies

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed in your project. These include react and react-dom. If they are not installed yet, use:

npm install react react-dom

3. Set up environment variables

This component requires a GitLab personal access token to fetch data from the GitLab API. Set the token in an environment file (.env) like so:

    Create a .env file in the root of your project.

VITE_GT_TOKEN=your_gitlab_token

You can obtain your GitLab personal access token from your GitLab account under Settings > Access Tokens.
4. Install Vite for development (Optional, if using Vite for bundling)

If you're using Vite for bundling, ensure Vite is installed in your project:

npm install vite --save-dev

Usage

After installation, you can use the GitLabContributionGraph component in your React project.

    Create a new component or file to test the contribution graph (e.g., sandbox.jsx).
    Import the component and use it with your GitLab username and token (stored in the .env file).

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import GitLabContributionGraph from "gitlab-contribution-graph";

// Fetch the GitLab token from environment variables
const gitlabToken = import.meta.env.VITE_GT_TOKEN;

const App = () => (
  <>
    <h1>Testing GitLab Contribution Graph</h1>
    <GitLabContributionGraph username="your_gitlab_username" token={gitlabToken} />
  </>
);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
